# Web Crawler

C# Web crawler application that given a URL, visits (crawls) all the URLs in the same domain. The application prints out each URL it visits and all the links it finds on that page (it won't necessarily visit them all as they might have already been visited).

## Running
To run the application there are 2 options:

1 . Run `WebCrawler` in your IDE

2 . Run `dotnet run`

You will be prompted to supply a URL; https://www.openai.com/ can be used as an example.
